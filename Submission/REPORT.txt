* To be confirmed with code *

The two paramters taken by train_deltas.sh is
1. Number of leaves in the decision tree: This parameter defines the number of sets of states that will be sharing the same likelihood model. That is for tying X Triphone models which have the middle monophone as M, if number of leaves are K, these X states (left context/right context..) will be partitioned K sets which share the same GMM parameters.

2. Total number of Gaussians: This is the sum of over all GMM likelihood models over all tied states of the Tied-State HMM model.
That is, if there are x sets of tied-states, where each tied-state set shares a y component GMM - Total number of Gaussians = x*y
